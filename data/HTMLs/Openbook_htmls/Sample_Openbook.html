		<p>This is a mysterious open book with a note...</p>
		
		<br/>
		<br/>

		<p>If anyone finds this my name is Elijah and I am currently in a town called Solnichniy.</p>

		<br/>

		<p>I am planning to head north but the infected here are making this difficult for me.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>I have some supplies that will last me a few days and could use help, if anyone finds this I will be heading north to a city called Berezino.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>I believe there is a hospital so I will try to set up camp there for a while but if I have to move on I will leave a note.</p>
		<br/>
		
		<p>Please be careful this virus is destroying everything in its path.</p>
